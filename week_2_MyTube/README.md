Features:- 
1. Copy of YouTube with video name, channel, views, date, like button and watch later button.
2. Nav bar including name, home and watch later button along with number of videos in it.
3. Styled using Bootstrap along with some inline styling, couldn't make the site much attractive because of limited experience in bootstrap.
4. Some issues with thumbnail photos, the placeholder website provided in the sample code isn't working on my device.
5. A continuous timer.
6. I haven't uploaded the node_modules as it was very large. Also the.gitignore is a hidden file so there can be issues in that.
